# Minimal dependencies for orscan pattern detection
#
# orscan core has NO external dependencies - it uses only Python stdlib.
# This file is empty by design. Install requirements.txt for full functionality.
#
# Basic detection (SSN, CC, email, etc.) works with just:
#   pip install -e .
#
# For file extraction and OCR, install the full requirements:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
